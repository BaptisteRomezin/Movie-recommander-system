# Movie-recommander-system

The project was to create a  movie recommandation system based on the movielens dataset.

Built a content based algorithm thats uses genres, average rating, number of ratings, tags...

Built a collaborative system that would recommend movies that were rated similarly to a movie inputed by the user.

Also a bit of webscrapping to pull images of the recommanded movies.

All of that was put in a streamlit app.
